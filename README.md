# What's Html Agility Pack (HAP)?
This is an agile HTML parser that builds a read/write DOM and supports plain XPATH or XSLT (you actually don't HAVE to understand XPATH nor XSLT to use it, don't worry...). It is a .NET code library that allows you to parse "out of the web" HTML files. The parser is very tolerant with "real world" malformed HTML. The object model is very similar to what proposes System.Xml, but for HTML documents (or streams).

NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/HtmlAgilityPack/

## Support

## Contribute

You want to help us? 
Your donation directly helps us maintaining and growing ZZZ Free Projects. We can’t thank you enough for your support.

### Why should I contribute to free & open source library?
We all love free and open source libraries!
But there is a catch! Nothing is free in this world.
Contributions allow us to spend more of our time on:

• Bug Fix

• Content Writing

• Development

• Support (GitHub, Mail, Stack Overflow)

We NEED your help. In 2020 alone, we spent over 3000 hours maintaining our open source libraries.
### How much should I contribute?
Any amount is much appreciated. All our libraries together have more than 10 million downloads, if everyone could contribute a tiny amount, it would help us to make the .NET community a better place to code!
### Where will my contribution go?
100% of contributions go toward support & development for our open source projects;

• Development of new projects
• Faster Support

• New Major Releases

Can I get an invoice for significant contribution? (only happened once… not worth mentioning if they want one of course we will do it)

Contact us for more information: info@zzzprojects.com


Another great free way to contribute is  **spreading the word** about the library:

 - Blog it
 - Comment it
 - Fork it
 - Star it
 - Share it
 
A **HUGE THANKS** for your help.
